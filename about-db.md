# About DB

Project depends on db that I located in different repository.
If you have access to this repository you can get it by using following commands:

(of course after cloning this project from main repository)

```bash
$ git submodule init
```

```bash
$ git submodule update
```

**or** you can clone project recursively with all submodules:

```bash
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:artemdemo/pm-app.git
```

More about submodules: [Git :: submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

If you don't have access to this repository it's ok, case new database will be created for you after the first run.
